**Notes:**

- Five (5) letters are vowels: **A, E, I, O, U,** while the others 21 are consonants : **B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, R, S, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.**
- Digraphs like ch, ci, ck, etc., are not separate letters of the alphabet.
- "A" and "I" are also standalone words.

Additionally, the letters `Y` and `W` can function as both consonants and vowels  
***Examples Y and W as Consonants and Vowels***

***Letter Y***:

- **Consonant**: In words like "yes" and "yellow," the letter Y functions as a consonant, representing the /j/ sound.
- **Vowel**: In words like "myth" and "gym," Y represents a vowel sound, often functioning as a vowel when there are no other vowels in the word or syllable [[1](https://www.merriam-webster.com/grammar/why-y-is-sometimes-a-vowel-usage)].

***Letter W***:

- **Consonant**: In words like "water" and "swim," W is typically a consonant, representing the /w/ sound [[2](https://www.dictionary.com/e/w-vowel/)].
- **Vowel**: While less common, W can function as a vowel in certain dialects or words, such as "cow" and "low," where it represents a /u/ or /ʊ/ sound.

These letters demonstrate their versatility by serving as both vowels and consonants depending on their phonetic role within a word or syllable.

<summary>Old English Alphabet</summary>

The Old English alphabet, recorded in 1011 by monk Byrhtferð, comprised 29 letters. It included the 24 letters of the Latin alphabet, such as A, B, C, ..., Z, & (ampersand), and also featured five additional English letters:

1. **Long S (ſ):** Representing the s sound, it resembled an elongated lowercase f.
2. **Eth (Ð and ð):** Denoted the th sound, similar to the modern "th" in "this."
3. **Thorn (þ):** Also symbolized the th sound, often confused with eth.
4. **Wynn (ƿ):** Represented the w sound, later replaced by the letter "w" in Modern English.
5. **Ash (ᚫ; later Æ and æ):** Signified the ae diphthong, eventually evolving into the ligature Æ in later Old English and eventually Modern English.

In Old English, the alphabet lacked the letters J, U, and W, which were introduced later in Modern English.
